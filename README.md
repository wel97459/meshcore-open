# MeshCore Open

Open-source Flutter client for MeshCore LoRa mesh networking devices.

## Overview

MeshCore Open is a cross-platform mobile application for communicating with MeshCore LoRa mesh network devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The app enables long-range, off-grid communication through peer-to-peer messaging, public channels, and mesh networking capabilities.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Direct Messaging**: Private encrypted conversations with individual contacts
- **Public Channels**: Broadcast messages to channel subscribers on the mesh network
- **Contact Management**: Organize contacts, track last seen times, and manage conversation history
- **Contact Groups**: Create custom groups to organize your mesh network contacts
- **Message Reactions**: React to messages with emoji responses
- **Message Replies**: Thread conversations with inline reply functionality

### Mesh Network
- **Path Visualization**: View routing paths and signal quality for each contact
- **Route Management**: Manual path overriding and automatic route rotation
- **Signal Metrics**: Real-time SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) tracking
- **Node Discovery**: Automatic detection of nearby mesh nodes
- **Repeater Support**: Connect to and manage repeater nodes for extended range

### Map & Location
- **Live Map View**: Real-time visualization of mesh network nodes on an interactive map
- **Node Filtering**: Filter by node type (chat, repeater, sensor) and time range
- **Location Sharing**: Share GPS coordinates and custom markers with contacts
- **Offline Maps**: Download map tiles for offline use in remote areas
- **MGRS Coordinates**: Support for Military Grid Reference System coordinate format

### Device Management
- **BLE Connection**: Scan and connect to MeshCore devices via Bluetooth
- **Device Settings**: Configure radio parameters, power settings, and network options
- **Battery Monitoring**: Real-time battery status with chemistry-specific voltage curves
- **Firmware Updates**: Over-the-air firmware updates via BLE (coming soon)

### Repeater Hub
- **CLI Access**: Full command-line interface to repeater nodes
- **Settings Management**: Configure repeater behavior, power limits, and network settings
- **Statistics Dashboard**: View repeater traffic, connected clients, and system health
- **Remote Management**: Administer repeaters from anywhere on the mesh network

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Flutter 3.38.5 / Dart 3.10.4
- **State Management**: Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier
- **BLE Protocol**: Nordic UART Service (NUS) over Bluetooth Low Energy
- **Storage**: Local SQLite database for messages and contact data
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for private messages using the MeshCore protocol

### Platform Support
- ✅ **Android**: Full support (API 21+)
- ✅ **iOS**: Full support (iOS 12+)
- 🚧 **Desktop**: Limited support (macOS/Linux/Windows)

## BLE Protocol

### Nordic UART Service (NUS)
- **Service UUID**: `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
- **RX Characteristic**: `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (Write to device)
- **TX Characteristic**: `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (Notify from device)

### Device Discovery
Devices are discovered by scanning for BLE advertisements with the name prefix `MeshCore-`

### Message Format
Messages are transmitted as binary frames using a custom protocol optimized for LoRa transmission. See `meshcore_protocol.dart` for frame structure definitions.

## Configuration

### App Settings
- **Theme**: System default, light, or dark mode
- **Notifications**: Configurable for messages, channels, and node advertisements
- **Battery Chemistry**: Support for NMC, LiFePO4, and LiPo battery types
- **Message Retry**: Automatic retry with configurable path clearing

### Device Settings
- **Radio Power**: Transmit power adjustment (10-30 dBm)
- **Frequency**: LoRa frequency configuration
- **Bandwidth**: Channel bandwidth selection
- **Spreading Factor**: Range vs. speed trade-off
- **Network ID**: Mesh network identifier

## Contributing

This is an open-source project. Contributions are welcome!

### Development Guidelines
- Follow the Flutter style guide
- Use Material 3 design components
- Write clear commit messages
- Test on both Android and iOS before submitting PRs

### Code Style
- Prefer `StatelessWidget` with `Consumer` for reactive UI
- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid premature abstractions
